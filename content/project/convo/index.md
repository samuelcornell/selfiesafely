summary: Selfies have been called everything from an artform to narcissistic and a sign of a dysfunctional society. They can also kill. When people go to extreme lengths to take an image to share on social media – perhaps in remote or picturesque locations – they can risk their lives. So we need to move beyond describing selfies as a social phenomenon, fuelled by the rise of smartphones and social media. We need to treat dangerous selfies as the public health hazard they really are.
